# git-start

This is a demo to connect git-start a repo in  GitHub with my local work machine
I have done git clone of the git-start repository to my work machine and start write on it.

- I this is from the GitHub. I dont understand why. the ssh keys dont work and I use PAT

- write from machine - it's bizzare I only use PAT
