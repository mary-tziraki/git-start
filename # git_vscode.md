# Learning Git at VScode

- second commit with the VS interface
I am trying to create a commit from the ...selecting commit then commitALL.
Go to the message and write the "1st way" as a commit message
Then hit the tick (the  v at git-start Git bar). This one way to create a commit
The process at lines 4 to 6 are followed after I open the git sign (with the brances) and be at SOURCE CONTROL.
underneeth there is a bar, It is git-start (the local repository) with an extension GIT. At the ... (end of the bar) select commit-> Commit ALl and repeat the process (lines 4 to 6)
write message "repeat 1st way" where the message appears.

Again:
- SOURCE SONTROL  click ...commitAll
-then modify the file and SAVE it, then Changes appear (underneeth source control)
-CHANGES you select the file you press + to stage it and then you write the commit message " 1st way repeat all steps"


The 2nd way is to make changes, stage them (click the git branch) and use the commit All (Ammend). 
It is like commit All but it has a little signature at the commit message.
Beware when it does ammending it doesnt show the previous commit but it overwrites it. so The previous commit will disappeared from the  Timeline.
