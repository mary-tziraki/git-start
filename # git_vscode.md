# Learning Git at VScode

- second commit with the VS interface
I am trying to create a commit from the ...selecting commit then commitALL.
Go to the message and write the "1st way" as a commit message
Then hit the tick (the  v at git-start Git bar). This one way to create a commit
The process at lines 4 to 6 are followed after I open the git sign (with the brances) and be at SOURCE CONTROL.
underneeth there is a bar, It is git-start (the local repository) with an extension GIT. At the ... (end of the bar) select commit-> Commit ALl and repeat the process (lines 4 to 6)
write message "repeat 1st way" where the message appears
